    ### 2. Measurement Methods
    
    **Direct Attribution**
    ```
    Referral codes: Ambassador123 → trackable signup
    UTM parameters: ?ref=community-post-xyz
    Survey responses: "How did you hear about us?"

    - Expansion rate
    - Support ticket volume
    - NPS score
    ```
    
    ### 3. ROI Calculation
    
    ```
    Community Value =
      (Attributed acquisition × CAC saved) +
      (Retention lift × LTV delta) +
      (Support deflection × Ticket cost) +
      (Content value × Production cost)
