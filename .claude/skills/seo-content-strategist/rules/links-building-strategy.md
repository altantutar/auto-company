## Link Building & Authority Strategy

**Impact: HIGH**

Backlinks remain one of the strongest ranking signals. But modern link building is about earning links through value, not acquiring them through manipulation. Quality over quantity — one link from a relevant, authoritative site beats 100 from irrelevant directories.

### Link Quality Factors

| Factor | What to Look For | Red Flags |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Domain Authority** | DA 40+ for most value | DA < 20, new domains |
| **Relevance** | Same industry/topic | Unrelated niches |
| **Traffic** | Site gets real visitors | Zero traffic sites |
| **Link placement** | Editorial, in-content | Footer, sidebar, blogroll |
| **Anchor text** | Natural, varied | Exact match keyword spam |
| **Follow status** | Dofollow preferred | All nofollow is suspicious |
| **Link neighborhood** | Quality outbound links | Links to spam sites |

### Link Building Tactics Ranked

| Tactic | Difficulty | Quality | Scalability | Best For |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Original research** | High | Very High | Low | Authority building |
| **Digital PR** | High | High | Medium | Brand + links |
| **Guest posting** | Medium | Medium-High | Medium | Targeted niches |
| **Resource link building** | Medium | Medium-High | Medium | Evergreen content |
| **Broken link building** | Medium | Medium | Medium | Quick wins |
| **HARO/Connectively** | Low | Medium | High | Volume |
| **Podcast guesting** | Medium | Medium | Low | Personal brand |
| **Tool/template pages** | High (initial) | High | High | Passive links |
| **Infographics** | Medium | Low-Medium | Low | Outdated tactic |
| **Directories** | Low | Low | High | Local SEO only |

### Link-Worthy Content Types

| Content Type | Link Appeal | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Original data/research** | Very High | "State of Secrets Management 2024" |
| **Industry survey** | High | "We surveyed 500 DevOps teams..." |
| **Definitive guide** | High | "Complete Guide to Zero Trust" |
| **Free tool/calculator** | Very High | "API Security Score Calculator" |
| **Templates/frameworks** | High | "Security Policy Templates" |
| **Comparison charts** | Medium | Detailed vendor comparisons |
| **Expert roundups** | Medium | "20 CTOs on Security Priorities" |
| **Case studies** | Medium | Customer success with data |

### Good Outreach Email

```
Subject: Quick question about your secrets management guide

Hi [Name],

I came across your article on [specific topic] while researching
Kubernetes security — the section on [specific detail] was
particularly helpful.

We just published research on how 500 development teams actually
manage secrets (spoiler: 67% still use .env files in production).

Given your audience cares about this topic, thought you might
find it useful as a reference. Here's the report:
[link]

Either way, thanks for the great content on [their site].

[Your name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific (shows you read their content)
- Provides value (not just asking for link)
- No explicit link request (soft approach)
- Short and respectful of time

### Bad Outreach Email

```
Subject: Link Exchange Opportunity!!!

Dear Webmaster,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John and I
represent [company]. We have recently published a comprehensive
article about secrets management that would be a perfect fit
for your website.

We would be grateful if you could add our link to your page.
In exchange, we will add a link to your site from our blog.

Please let me know if you're interested in this mutually
beneficial opportunity.

Best regards,
John
