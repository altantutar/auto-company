# SCQA Framework (Structure Thinking)

## Overview

SCQA is McKinsey's widely-used structured thinking and communication framework that transforms complex problems into clear narrative structures.

**The 4 Elements**:
- **S (Situation)** - Context: background and current state
- **C (Complication)** - Conflict: problems and challenges
- **Q (Question)** - Query: the core question
- **A (Answer)** - Solution: proposed resolution

**Core Value**: Converting complexity into clarity through narrative structure

## When to Use

Ideal for:
- 📊 Understanding article argumentation structure
- 📝 Organizing complex problem logic
- 💼 Analyzing business cases
- 🎯 Evaluating solution reasonableness
- 📋 Restructuring information for logical flow
- 🗣️ Preparing presentations or reports

## The Four Elements in Detail

### S - Situation (Context)

**Definition**: Stable, mutually-agreed background facts

#### Identification Method
```markdown
## Identifying Situation

Look for "background" descriptions in article:
- Industry status
- Historical development
- Market environment
- Existing consensus
- Basic facts

Extraction formula:
"At [time], [subject] in [field/industry] is in [state]"
```

#### Quality Situation Characteristics
- ✅ Objective description, minimal subjective judgment
- ✅ Generally agreed upon
- ✅ Sets stage for upcoming complication
- ✅ Relevant but doesn't delve into details

#### Example
```markdown
**Situation**:
"Over the past decade, remote work technology (video conferencing, collaboration tools) has matured.
Many knowledge companies began piloting flexible work arrangements pre-pandemic.
Employee expectations for work flexibility continue rising."

Analysis:
- ✅ States facts
- ✅ Neutral description
- ✅ Establishes discussion scope
```

### C - Complication (Conflict/Challenge)

**Definition**: Change, problem, or challenge that disrupts balance

#### Identification Method
```markdown
## Identifying Complication

Look for "turning point" signal words:
- But, however, yet
- The problem is
- The challenge is
- Concerningly
- X situation emerged

Types:
1. External changes: market, technology, policy shifts
2. Internal problems: resource shortages, capability gaps
3. Expectation gaps: expectations vs. reality
4. Emerging threats: competition, risks
```

#### Quality Complication Characteristics
- ✅ Creates tension and urgency
- ✅ Clarifies "why change is needed"
- ✅ Contrasts with Situation
- ✅ Naturally leads to Question

#### Example
```markdown
**Complication**:
"However, sudden widespread remote work exposed many problems:
- Managers struggle to assess team productivity
- Employees feel isolated and disconnected
- Company culture faces dilution risks
- Cybersecurity threats significantly increased"

Analysis:
- ✅ Contrasts with Situation
- ✅ Creates urgency
- ✅ Specific and tangible
```

### Q - Question (Core Query)

**Definition**: The central question arising from the complication

#### Identification Method
```markdown
## Identifying Question

Explicit questions:
- Questions article directly poses
- "How to...?"
- "Should we...?"

Implicit questions:
- Derived from S→C logic
- Questions author wants to answer but doesn't explicitly state

Question types:
