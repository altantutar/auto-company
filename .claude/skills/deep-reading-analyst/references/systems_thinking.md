# Systems Thinking Framework

## Core Principle

Understand parts in relation to the whole. Systems are more than the sum of parts due to interactions.

## Key System Elements

### 1. Components (Elements)
The individual parts of the system

### 2. Relationships (Interconnections)  
How components influence each other

### 3. Purpose (Function)
What the system is designed to achieve

### 4. Boundaries
What's inside vs. outside the system

## Causal Loop Analysis

### Reinforcing Loop (Positive Feedback)
Creates exponential growth or collapse

```
A increases → B increases → A increases further → ...
```

**Examples:**
- Network effects: More users → More value → More users
- Panic: Fear → Selling → Price drop → More fear
- Expertise: Skill → Opportunities → More practice → More skill

**Symbol:** R (Reinforcing)

### Balancing Loop (Negative Feedback)
Creates stability and resistance to change

```
A increases → B increases → A decreases → B decreases → ...
```

**Examples:**
- Thermostat: Temp up → Heating off → Temp down → Heating on
- Supply/Demand: Price up → Demand down → Price down
- Homeostasis: Blood sugar up → Insulin up → Blood sugar down

**Symbol:** B (Balancing)

## Mapping Template

```markdown
## System Components
- Component A: [Role/function]
- Component B: [Role/function]
- Component C: [Role/function]

## Key Relationships

[A] ──+──> [B]  (A increases B)
       |
       └──-──> [C]  (A decreases C)

## Feedback Loops

### Loop 1: [Name] (R/B)
A → B → C → A
Effect: [Exponential growth / Stabilization]

## System Behavior Over Time

Current state: [X]
If X increases: [Trace effects through system]
If X decreases: [Trace effects through system]
```

## Leverage Points

Places to intervene (Donella Meadows' hierarchy, strongest to weakest):

1. **Paradigms** - Mental models underlying the system
2. **Goals** - Purpose of the system
3. **System structure** - Feedback loop architecture
4. **Delays** - Response time between cause and effect
5. **Balancing loops** - Strength of stabilizing forces
6. **Reinforcing loops** - Strength of amplifying forces
7. **Information flows** - Who knows what, when
8. **Rules** - Incentives, constraints
9. **Buffers** - Stabilizing stocks
10. **Stock-flow structures** - Physical components
11. **Parameters** - Numbers (least effective)

**Insight:** Most people tweak parameters (#11), but changing paradigms (#1) is far more powerful.

## Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition

### Similar System Patterns Across Fields

**Tragedy of the Commons:**
- Environment: Overfishing
- Digital: Bandwidth congestion  
- Social: Public resource depletion
- Organizational: Shared resource competition

**Network Effects:**
- Technology: Social media platforms
