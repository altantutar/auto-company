# Research Report: [Topic]

<!-- =============================================================================
PROGRESSIVE FILE ASSEMBLY STRATEGY (2025 - Unlimited Length):

This report is generated section-by-section using progressive file assembly.
Each section is generated to APPROPRIATE depth (however many words needed) and
written to file immediately using Write/Edit tools.

WHY: Manages output token limits while maintaining quality throughout
RESULT: Large reports (up to 20,000 words per skill run) - sections sized naturally by content

CLAUDE CODE LIMIT: 32,000 output tokens (≈20,000 words max per run)
For reports >20,000 words: Run skill multiple times for different parts

GENERATION WORKFLOW:
1. Generate Executive Summary → Write to file
   (As long as needed for comprehensive summary)

2. Generate Introduction → Edit/append to file
   (As long as needed to establish context)

3. Generate Finding 1 → Edit/append to file
   (As long as needed to fully present evidence and analysis)

4. Generate Finding 2 → Edit/append to file
   (Each finding sized appropriately - some may need 300 words, others 1,500)

5. Continue for ALL findings (no limit on number OR length per finding!)

6. Generate Synthesis → Edit/append to file
   (As long as needed for deep synthesis)

7. Generate Limitations → Edit/append to file
8. Generate Recommendations → Edit/append to file
9. Generate Bibliography (ALL citations) → Edit/append to file
10. Generate Methodology → Edit/append to file

SIZING PRINCIPLE:
- Each section should be as long as IT NEEDS TO BE
- Simple finding? Maybe 400 words is enough
- Complex multi-faceted finding? Could be 1,200 words
- Let evidence and analysis determine length, not arbitrary targets
- Only constraint: Keep each INDIVIDUAL generation under ~2,000 words to avoid output limits
- If a section needs >2,000 words, break it into subsections and generate progressively

CITATION TRACKING (CRITICAL):
- Maintain running list in working memory: citations_used = [1, 2, 3, ...]
- After each section: Add new citations to list
- In Bibliography: Generate entry for EVERY citation in final list
- NO gaps, NO ranges, NO placeholders

============================================================================= -->

<!-- WRITING STANDARDS (Apply to EACH section): -->
<!-- - PRECISION: Each word deliberately chosen, carries intention -->
<!-- - ECONOMY: No fluff, eliminate fancy grammar, unnecessary adjectives -->
<!-- - CLARITY: Use exact numbers, specific data, precise technical terms -->
<!-- - DIRECTNESS: State findings without embellishment -->
<!-- - HIGH SIGNAL-TO-NOISE: Respect reader's time, dense information -->
<!-- Examples: "reduced mortality 23%" not "significantly improved outcomes" -->
<!-- Examples: "5 RCTs (n=1,847)" not "several studies suggest" -->

<!-- SOURCE ATTRIBUTION (CRITICAL - PREVENTS FABRICATION): -->
<!-- EVERY factual claim MUST be followed by [N] citation in same sentence -->
<!-- Use "According to [1]..." or "[1] reports..." for factual statements -->
<!-- DISTINGUISH fact from synthesis: -->
<!--   ✅ GOOD: "Mortality decreased 23% (p<0.01) in treatment group [1]." -->
<!--   ❌ BAD: "Studies show mortality improved significantly." -->
<!-- NO vague attributions like "research suggests" or "experts believe" -->
<!-- ADMIT uncertainty: "No sources found for X" not fabricated citations -->
<!-- LABEL speculation: "This suggests..." not "Research shows..." -->

<!-- ANTI-TRUNCATION (CRITICAL - Each Section Must Be COMPLETE): -->
<!-- ❌ FORBIDDEN: "Content continues...", "Due to length...", "[Sections X-Y...]" -->
<!-- ✅ REQUIRED: Generate current section COMPLETELY (you're only writing 500 words!) -->
<!-- ✅ REQUIRED: Write to file immediately, then move to next section -->
<!-- Progressive assembly handles unlimited length - you handle quality per section -->
