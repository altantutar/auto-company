# Evidence Hierarchy and Quality Assessment

## Traditional Evidence Hierarchy (Medical/Clinical)

### Level 1: Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
**Description:** Comprehensive synthesis of all available evidence on a question.

**Strengths:**
- Combines multiple studies for greater power
- Reduces impact of single-study anomalies
- Can identify patterns across studies
- Quantifies overall effect size

**Weaknesses:**
- Quality depends on included studies ("garbage in, garbage out")
- Publication bias can distort findings
- Heterogeneity may make pooling inappropriate
- Can mask important differences between studies

**Critical evaluation:**
- Was search comprehensive (multiple databases, grey literature)?
- Were inclusion criteria appropriate and prespecified?
- Was study quality assessed?
- Was heterogeneity explored?
- Was publication bias assessed (funnel plots, fail-safe N)?
- Were appropriate statistical methods used?

### Level 2: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
**Description:** Experimental studies with random assignment to conditions.

**Strengths:**
- Gold standard for establishing causation
- Controls for known and unknown confounders
- Minimizes selection bias
- Enables causal inference

**Weaknesses:**
- May not be ethical or feasible
- Artificial settings may limit generalizability
- Often short-term with selected populations
- Expensive and time-consuming

**Critical evaluation:**
- Was randomization adequate (sequence generation, allocation concealment)?
- Was blinding implemented (participants, providers, assessors)?
- Was sample size adequate (power analysis)?
- Was intention-to-treat analysis used?
- Was attrition rate acceptable and balanced?
- Are results generalizable?

### Level 3: Cohort Studies
**Description:** Observational studies following groups over time.

**Types:**
- **Prospective:** Follow forward from exposure to outcome
- **Retrospective:** Look backward at existing data

**Strengths:**
- Can study multiple outcomes
- Establishes temporal sequence
- Can calculate incidence and relative risk
- More feasible than RCTs for many questions

**Weaknesses:**
- Susceptible to confounding
- Selection bias possible
- Attrition can bias results
- Cannot prove causation definitively

**Critical evaluation:**
- Were cohorts comparable at baseline?
- Was exposure measured reliably?
- Was follow-up adequate and complete?
- Were potential confounders measured and controlled?
- Was outcome assessment blinded to exposure?

### Level 4: Case-Control Studies
**Description:** Compare people with outcome (cases) to those without (controls), looking back at exposures.

**Strengths:**
- Efficient for rare outcomes
- Relatively quick and inexpensive
- Can study multiple exposures
- Useful for generating hypotheses

**Weaknesses:**
- Cannot calculate incidence
- Susceptible to recall bias
- Selection of controls is challenging
- Cannot prove causation

**Critical evaluation:**
- Were cases and controls defined clearly?
- Were controls appropriate (same source population)?
- Was matching appropriate?
- How was exposure ascertained (records vs. recall)?
- Were potential confounders controlled?
- Could recall bias explain findings?

### Level 5: Cross-Sectional Studies
**Description:** Snapshot observation at single point in time.

**Strengths:**
- Quick and inexpensive
- Can assess prevalence
- Useful for hypothesis generation
- Can study multiple outcomes and exposures

**Weaknesses:**
- Cannot establish temporal sequence
- Cannot determine causation
- Prevalence-incidence bias
- Survival bias

**Critical evaluation:**
- Was sample representative?
- Were measures validated?
- Could reverse causation explain findings?
- Are confounders acknowledged?

### Level 6: Case Series and Case Reports
**Description:** Description of observations in clinical practice.

**Strengths:**
- Can identify new diseases or effects
- Hypothesis-generating
- Details rare phenomena
- Quick to report

**Weaknesses:**
- No control group
- No statistical inference possible
- Highly susceptible to bias
- Cannot establish causation or frequency

**Use:** Primarily for hypothesis generation and clinical description.

### Level 7: Expert Opinion
**Description:** Statements by recognized authorities.

**Strengths:**
- Synthesizes experience
- Useful when no research available
- May integrate multiple sources

**Weaknesses:**
- Subjective and potentially biased
- May not reflect current evidence
- Appeal to authority fallacy risk
- Individual expertise varies

**Use:** Lowest level of evidence; should be supported by data when possible.

## Nuances and Limitations of Traditional Hierarchy

### When Lower-Level Evidence Can Be Strong
1. **Well-designed observational studies** with:
   - Large effects (hard to confound)
   - Dose-response relationships
   - Consistent findings across contexts
   - Biological plausibility
   - No plausible confounders
