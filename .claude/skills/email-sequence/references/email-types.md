## Onboarding Emails

### New Users Series
**Trigger**: User signs up (free or trial)
**Goal**: Activate user, drive to aha moment
**Typical sequence**: 5-7 emails over 14 days

- Email 1: Welcome + single next step (immediate)
- Email 2: Quick win / getting started (day 1)
- Email 3: Key feature highlight (day 3)
- Email 4: Success story / social proof (day 5)
- Email 5: Check-in + offer help (day 7)
- Email 6: Advanced tip (day 10)
- Email 7: Upgrade prompt or next milestone (day 14)

**Key metrics**: Activation rate, feature adoption

### New Customers Series
**Trigger**: User converts to paid
**Goal**: Reinforce purchase decision, drive adoption, reduce early churn
**Typical sequence**: 3-5 emails over 14 days

- Email 1: Thank you + what's next (immediate)
- Email 2: Getting full value — setup checklist (day 2)
- Email 3: Pro tips for paid features (day 5)
- Email 4: Success story from similar customer (day 7)
- Email 5: Check-in + introduce support resources (day 14)

**Key point**: Different from new user series—they've committed. Focus on reinforcement and expansion, not conversion.
