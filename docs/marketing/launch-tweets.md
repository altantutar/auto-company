**Author:** marketing-godin
**Purpose:** Launch announcement for crypto Twitter and AI Twitter. Build-in-public angle.

## Standalone Tweet Options

### Option A — The Cold Open

```
14 AI agents just built a DeFi product from scratch.

No human wrote a single line of code.

Market research. CEO go/no-go. Protocol design. 2,500 lines of Solidity. Security audit. UX. Frontend. QA.

It's live:
https://altantutar.github.io/yield-router/

The pipeline is the product.

### Option B — The Numbers Hit

```
We let 14 AI agents run an autonomous company.

They shipped:
- 2,500 lines of Solidity (47 tests)
- Security audit (6 issues found + fixed)
- 3,400-line frontend
- 14 documents
- 0 lines of human code

A real ERC-4626 yield vault on Base.

Live: https://altantutar.github.io/yield-router/
```

### Option C — The Provocation

```
"AI can't build real products."

14 agents. Zero human code. One DeFi protocol.

Bezos-persona CEO made the GO call. samczsun-style agent found 6 security bugs. DHH-persona built the frontend.

It shipped. It's live.

### Option D — The Builder Angle

```
What happens when you give 14 AI agents a mission — "find demand, build a product, ship it" — and walk away?

They built a yield vault on Base. Audited it. Designed the UX. Wrote the frontend. Found 4 bugs in QA and fixed them.

Zero human code.

## Thread Option — The Full Pipeline Walkthrough

### Tweet 1/5

```
We built an autonomous AI company with 14 agents.

Their first mission: ship a real DeFi product.

No human touched the code. No human approved the design. No human fixed the bugs.

Here's what happened. (thread)
```

### Tweet 2/5

```
Run 1 — 9 agents, strategy through implementation:

1. Research agent scanned Base DeFi, found the gap
2. CEO agent (Bezos persona) gave the GO
3. Protocol designer wrote the mechanism
4. Tokenomics agent said NO TOKEN — passed all 5 Ponzi checks
5. 2,500 lines of Solidity, 47 tests passing
6. Security auditor found 6 issues. All fixed.
```

### Tweet 3/5

```
Run 2 — 5 agents, building the product people touch:

7. UX designer (Cooper persona) mapped 38 screen states for 3 user personas
8. Visual designer created a 750-line design system from scratch
9. Frontend dev shipped 3,400 lines — landing page + full dApp
10. QA agent found 4 bugs. Filed them. Agents fixed them.

No human in the loop. At any point.
```

### Tweet 4/5

```
The thing people miss:

This is not "AI generated a website." That's a party trick.

This is a research team identifying market demand, an executive making a resource allocation decision, engineers building to spec, a security team breaking their own code, and a QA team shipping quality.

The pipeline is the product.
```

### Tweet 5/5

```
It's live. Go look at it:
https://altantutar.github.io/yield-router/

Contracts are ready for Base Sepolia. 14 documents generated. Every decision is traceable.

The question was never "can AI write code."

The question is: can AI agents run a company?

We just got the first data point.
```

## Posting Strategy

**Target audiences (in order of priority):**
1. AI builders / AI Twitter — they care about the pipeline, the architecture, the agent coordination
2. Crypto Twitter — they care that it is a real ERC-4626 vault, no token, actual security audit
3. Indie hackers / build-in-public — they care about zero-human-code, the autonomous company concept

**Timing:** Post the standalone tweet first. If it gets traction in the first 30 minutes, drop the thread as a quote tweet. Do not post both simultaneously — let the standalone breathe.

**Engagement strategy:**
- Reply to your own standalone tweet with the live link again (algorithmic boost)
- Have a "making of" screenshot ready (the pipeline visualization / mission control dashboard)
- Be ready to answer "but did a human really not touch the code?" with commit history links

**Do NOT:**
- Use the word "revolutionary" or "game-changing"
- Add rocket emojis or hype language
- Claim the product is production-ready for mainnet (it is testnet-ready, be honest)
- Oversell — the facts are remarkable enough. Let them do the work.

**Key reframe if challenged:** "We are not saying AI replaces developers. We are saying 14 specialized agents coordinating autonomously is a new unit of production. The company is the product."
